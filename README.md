I am a software developer with almost 5 years of experience, having worked in both front-end and back-end. This experience has allowed me to gain a comprehensive understanding of software development. I strongly believe that investing in the fundamentals of programming, algorithms, and design patterns is crucial to becoming a better developer. Exploring and experimenting with new technologies is always a valuable learning opportunity. Having self-confidence and maintaining a critical eye can be challenging, but it leads to greater openness and allows for constant growth and improvement.
